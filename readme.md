## **Application Purpose**
PlantApp is a terminal application built in Python. It's intent is to assist users with some basic care-taking of their indoor house-plants. At the time of creation, the app supports 15 varieties of popular indoor house-plants. During use of the app, the user will create a 'collection' of their own plants with the ability to add or remove them as the please. Stored inside the app is data related to each of the supported plants. The data includes how often you should water and re-pot each plant and the appropriate location the plant should be kept to ensure the right amount of sunlight. The app will ask the user when they last watered and re-pot each plant in their collection. It will also ask if each of their plants is kept near a window or not. Based on the information submitted by the user, the app will generate helpful recommendations by comparing the user data to the data stored by the app. 

The purpose of building this app is to demonstrate my ability to design, implement and test a terminal application in Python, and throughout the process, demonstrate that I am able to use a range of developer tools. The breif for this assignment is to accept user input in the form of a file or text input and produce printed output or interact with the file system.
